      <description>If we interpret a polyhedron as a set of points, two polyhedra represented by sets \(A\) and \(B\), for example, collide if \(A \cap B \neq \emptyset\). The intersection set \(A \cap B\) represents all pairs of points between \(A\) and \(B\) which have distance \(0\) between them.
A very nice operation between sets of points is the Minkowski Sum:
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two point sets. The Minkowski sum \(A \oplus B\) is defined as the set</description>

      <description>It is possible to arrange multi-dimensional data into an one-dimensional data structure in several ways by defining an ordering pattern, such as Hilbert curve and Z-Order Curve. This type of arrangement provides memory-efficient *-tree representations and helps to maximize cache hit queries on certain types of operations - neighborhood search on grids for example.
The Z-Order Curve, also called Morton Order, creates a &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; pattern on data traversal. The red lines on the Figure below show this pattern on the 2D example for different levels of a quad-tree:</description>

      <title>Interpolations on Semi-Lagrangian Advection Schemes</title>

      <description>When advecting some quantity field \(q\) (a velocity component, smoke density or temperature value for example) over the velocity field \(\vec{u}\) using a Semi-Lagrangian scheme, we need to trace back in time to get the new grid values.
Imagine a particle carrying a specific quantity value being passively advected by the fluid flow. In a given instant of time \(t_n\), the particle ending at position \(\vec{x}_e\) started its trajectory at point \(\vec{x}_s\).</description>
